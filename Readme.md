# voidlinux-iso-extra

This is almost official ISO for [Linux Void](https://voidlinux.org/). It has few additional packages that I find essential but are missing in official ISO.

This repo contains instruction for building it yourself and link to ISO generated by me.

## Regenerate ISO

Internet is required for your system and also for Void inside VirtualBox.

1. Install VirtualBox.
2. Download latest minimal ISO for x86_64 from official website [https://alpha.de.repo.voidlinux.org/live/current/](https://alpha.de.repo.voidlinux.org/live/current/) (e.g. `void-live-x86_64-20191109.iso`).
3. Add new system to VirtualBox.
    * Create 6 GB virtual disk hard drive.
    * Add more RAM (1-2 GB should be OK).
    * Add more CPU (2 is already better)
4. Install Voidlinux in virtualbox.
    * Run Voidlinux from RAM (will be faster).
    * Login as root.
    * Run `void-installer`.
    * Choose local installation (not network installation).
    * Create one partition for /.
    * After installation reboot into new system (not livecd again).
5. Login as root.
6. Copy gen.sh into any ssh server.
7. Use scp to download gen.sh into /root/ in Voidlinux inside virtualbox. (E.g. `scp me@myserver:gen.sh /root`)
8. Run script: `bash /root/gen.sh`
9. New ISO will be in folder /root/void-mklive/. Use scp to copy it outside VirtualBox.

Done!

## Github Actions

I don't use GA for this project and generate ISOs by hand. However it could be useful for others so I added text file with workflow that generates ISO on commit push. Consider that generated ISO is larger than 500 MB so it may be required to use paid github plan.
